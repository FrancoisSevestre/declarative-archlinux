* AutoInstall - Archlinux
These scripts aims to automate the installation of archlinux from an installation medium.
This project uses a declarative approach: The user customizes a configuration
file (config.yml) that contains all the informations requiered for the installation.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Use git to clone this repository to your arch installation medium
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://gitlab.com/francoissevestre/declarative-archlinux.git
cd declarative-archlinux
# At this step you should edit the configuration file "config.yml"
bash start.sh
#+END_SRC
The script execution can be stopped at any moment by using ~Ctrl+C~ and then
re-run if necessairy.

The user should adapt this file to it's own needs. Gidelines are provided in the
default file as comments.
